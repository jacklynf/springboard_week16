This was fun and relatively easy to implement. I am really glad we covered this in our
Sunday session last week as that made it MUCH easier to understand. The documentation
is helpful but it has a lot going on. Having the practice last Sunday made this exercise
much more manageable.

First, I implemented the single test function by making it fail then getting it to pass.
Then, I implemented the fixture, golden data, and adjusted the test function 
accordingly. It passed initially, so I messed with the data to create some failures
just to make sure everything was working as intended. Once I confirmed that was the case,
I corrected the bad data and added a few more tests.
